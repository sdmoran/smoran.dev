      <p> This is the personal website of Sam Moran. That's me! I'm currently studying computer science, and thought I would build a website to get a feel for some of the technologies used in web development. Also, this site lets me showcase my portfolio of projects I've worked on in the past! Feel free to look around at some of them. My Q-Learning with Bomberman project is probably my favorite, though I enjoyed all of them :)</p>
